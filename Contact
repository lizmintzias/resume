Hi Philip,

I wanted to reach out because I came across your resume while looking for strong DevOps Engineers for my clients in NY. 
Clearly I'm not a coder. But from what I do see on your Github, it looks like you are working with some great technologies.  
Any chance you are open to new opportunities?
Feel free to ping me back at elizabeth@fildit.com

Best,
Elizabeth Mintzias
